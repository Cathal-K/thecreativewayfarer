                        <div class="article-page-content">
                            <p>It was 2017. I was 23 and I had decided to leave my job, grab a backpack and do a six week solo trip around China.</p><br>
                            <p>Having never done any solo-travel before, I decided that an organised tour wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted for my first experience of solo-travel and I had picked China because I wanted a challenge. I didn&rsquo;t speak the language (aside from a few phrases I&rsquo;d picked up before I went) but I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable and tough enough to rely on myself to do it.</p><br>
                            <p>After realising my heart was set on this, the reality of how much there was to organise felt very daunting. Flights, visas, money, accomodation, transport?! It all felt like a big tangle that was hard to unravel. However, over a good few months of preparing for the trip I did a lot of research and broke it down to make it easier for people that are just starting out!</p><br>
                            <p>I had such an absolutely incredible 6 weeks in China - I made friends with the locals, chatted with fellow travellers and got to explore all at my own pace. Going solo meant that I wasn&rsquo;t relying on anyone else. If I was feeling a bit lonely, I had to introduce myself to new people and make new friends. It also meant there were no arguments about what sights to see and I could take as long as I needed to draw or photograph something without feeling guilty. It definitely helped shape me into a more self-aware person, content with my own company and I feel that my creativity was able to flourish when given the breathing space. I want to encourage as many people to see the world solo (at least once!) to see how it benefits their creativity.</p><br>
                            <h4>1) Decide on the Country or Countries that you want to visit.</h4><br>
                            <p>My original plan was to check out a few countries in the 6 weeks that I had, but I swiftly realised that even a full 6 weeks in China barely scratches the surface. As someone who has stretched herself too thin in previous trips, I would recommend sticking to a place and exploring it more in-depth if you are able to.</p><br>
                            <h4>2) Check the visa requirements for that country</h4><br>
                            <p>Check your passport&rsquo;s rules and requirements for the country or countries you want to visit. Some passports are more &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; than others (allow you to get in to more countries without requiring a visa) and it&rsquo;s super important to ensure you check these WELL before you leave.</p><br>
                            <p>For example:</p><br>
                            <p>Are you able to get one on entry? Do you need one before you take off? If you can only get one on entry, how much will this cost (After being caught out in Cambodia without $USD for the visa, it&rsquo;s not an oversight I want to make again!)?</p><br>
                            <p>Do you need to have proof of onwards travel?</p><br>
                            <p>Most, if not all, of these answers are just a quick google search away.</p><br>
                            <p>&nbsp;If you are allowed to visit the countries you want Visa free, check how long you are allowed to stay in that country for.</p><br>
                            <p>Countries such as Thailand have 30 day tourist visas, and parts of Europe that are in the Schengen Zone have a 90 out of 180 day limit.</p><br>
                            <p>Consequences can be severe for those who overstay, so be vigilant and make sure you leave when you are supposed to!</p><br>
                            <h4>3) Decide when to travel</h4><br>
                            <p>This will differ significantly depending on your situation. If you&rsquo;re working full time, it may be that you get certain set holidays meaning you&rsquo;re only able to travel between those dates, or if you&rsquo;re doing a gap year, perhaps money is more of your concern. The majority of countries have a &ldquo;high&rdquo; season, a &ldquo;low&rdquo; season and &ldquo;shoulder&rdquo; seasons.</p><br>
                            <p>High season is when the most tourists come to visit (big public holidays, Summer etc.), prices are usually pumped up and accommodation can be booked out well in advance.<br /> Low seasons are generally cheaper and quieter but the weather tends towards being colder/ stormier/ rainier etc.<p><br>
                            <p>The Shoulder seasons are either side of the high and low, and are usually a nice middle ground - not the cheapest, but not as expensive as when most people are going.</p><br>
                            <p>Research where you want visit, research your options then decide on possible dates!</p><br>
                            <h4>4) Research common scams, places to avoid and learn the basics of travel safety</h4><br>
                            <p>Aside from a couple of negative experiences that I have had, travelling solo has been a safe and a truly positive life changing thing for me.</p><br>
                            <p>&nbsp;I recommend researching a bit about safe or unsafe areas to avoid beforehand to make sure that you can be well informed and make good choices when you are out on the road.</p><br>
                            <p>The basics of travel safety include: not flashing your cash, or carrying large amounts of cash when you can avoid it, not telling people that you are alone unless you trust them, not drinking too much, if you&rsquo;re in a crowded space safety pinning your bags zips together so they are not easily opened etc.</p><br>
                            <p>Most of these are common sense and just being aware of your surroundings.</p><br>
                            <h4>5) Find stuff that interests you!</h4><br>
                            <p>There&rsquo;s a good chance you already have some idea of what you want to go and see in the country whether it be extraordinary art museums, the best vistas to plein-air paint or awe inspiring routes to hike, but I like to try and dig a little deeper before I go.</p><br>
                            <p>I always want to get the most out of my trips, and also don&rsquo;t want to find out only when I get there that X is only open particular times of the year, or that you have to sign up for an activity before you arrive.</p><br>
                            <h4>6) Plan a route</h4><br>
                            <p>I would begin by looking where you are flying in to and out of, then look at the stuff that you really&nbsp;want to see. How far away are these things? Are you able to take a bus or train, or will you have to fly or take a boat?</p><br>
                            <p>I found marking things on a map then connecting the dots was super helpful to making the start of a route plan!</p><br>
                            <p>I would highly recommend NOT overloading your schedule though - give yourself enough time to travel to these places and see&nbsp;them; not just rushing through everything and feeling stressed out!.</p><br>
                            <p>For China I had to have all my accomodation booked in advance to be allowed to get my Visa, but I made sure that the hostels I booked were refundable.</p><br>
                            <p>Having my accomodation booked in advance was massive relief as it allowed me to focus on the more important things, like exploring, making friends and finding nice places to eat! On the few occasions I did need to alter my schedule because some cool opportunity came up, I was glad to have booked refundable rooms and be flexible!</p><br>
                            <h4>7) Start booking!</h4><br>
                            <p>Sweet! You know where you&rsquo;re going, what your visa and passport deal is, you&rsquo;ve decided what you want to do and when to go. Now it&rsquo;s time to start booking!</p><br>
                            <p>PRO TIP: Use the Private Browsing/ Incognito mode on your phone or laptop - a lot of companies bump up their prices if they see you&rsquo;ve been looking for a while at certain locations/ flights etc.</p><br>
                            <p>FLIGHTS: I always use Skyscanner as I&rsquo;ve always found that it gives the best search results and the site is easy to use. It&rsquo;s a fantastic website that allows you to search a range of airlines for the best prices and fights.</p><br>
                            <p>ACCOMODATION: I usually check a range of sources for accomodation, though Expedia and Hostelworld are usually my go-to options. Ranking by price and rating means you can usually find some great places to stay!</p><br>
                            <p>TRAVEL INSURANCE: I always book travel insurance if I&rsquo;m going on a long journey (and especially&nbsp;if you are going to the USA) just for peace of mind. Make sure you read the small print before you buy it to make sure you&rsquo;re actually covered for the things that you&rsquo;re doing and for any possessions you have.</p><br>
                            <h4>8) Packing and prepping</h4><br>
                            <p>Pack light and take only what you need.</p><br>
                            <p>Be sure to check the weather where you&rsquo;re going to make sure you&rsquo;re packing for the right season/ climate! No good wasting valuable packing space on a thick jacket if you&rsquo;re travelling to Thailand in the humid season.</p><br>
                            <p>Ensuring your passport is packed and that you have ways to pay when you&rsquo;re overseas are your main priorities! Having some cash on hand can be useful or a debit/credit card with minimal fees.</p><br>
                            <p><br />PRO TIP: Credit card and debit cards usually charge transaction fees for foreign currency; an extra $2 or so every transaction really starts to add up! Check what card you have as this can be a real budget destroyer. If you&rsquo;ve got one that charges a lot, either look at switching to a different card or minimizing how often you use it.</p><br>
                            <h4>9) Leaving time!</h4><br>
                            <p>Make sure you know how long it&rsquo;ll take to get to the airport and what time you need to be there before&nbsp;your flight leaves. Consider checking in online to save some time in advance. Sometimes this doesn't make too much of a difference, and sometimes it has saved me a good hour or more, so I always do it every time now.</p><br>
                            <p>Then hop on your flight, sit back, relax and enjoy your first solo backpacking trip!</p><br>
                            <p>I hope this guide has been helpful! I really do encourage people to give solo travel a go at least once in their life, and now armed with a handy step-by-step guide you can go forth and start your own solo backpacking trip!</p><br>
